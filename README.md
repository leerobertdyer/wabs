# WriteABadSong
A social Media website based around songwriting that encourages quantity over quality, and promotes collaboration.

Still very much in development ;)

# BUGS:
-   Sort function not working on star click. It reverts to newest, but doesn't change the title of filter...
-   If you register, but decline to authorize dbx, then there is nothing in place to stop you from submitting, it will end up with an error
        to solve it I'll need to implement a redirect to auth when a user without a token tries to submit

# WORK LOG:
To Do:
-   Work on 'collab' section. To start can just be a feed like profile and main pages.
-   The feed will only display songs that 'opted in' for collab

-   Once I have that functional, I could add an option for song critiques/feedback

-   I need to start implementing a points system, and pages to display the current monthly winner...
-   Badges for collaboraters/monthly winners/most active

-   messaging on posts
-   DM messaging capability

-   notifications via email and/or text

-   in submit, I need to clarify whether they are submitting a full song, or just words and give them the appropriate form depending...
