# WriteABadSong
A social Media website based around songwriting that encourages quantity over quality, and promotes collaboration.

Still very much in development ;)


# WORK LOG:
PROGRESS!
-   After weeks, I've finally managed to implement extended dropbox tokens to each new user on registration. 
        -I'll need to now use the links from the files to update the song player and feed the home page with a scrollable element.
    -I need my homepage to be a feed that displays the most current "posts"
        -A 'post' can be a song, a status change, a lyrics looking for song, a song looking for lyrics, a new user signed up, a profile pic change.
            -I'll need a new bridge table that collects each new submission and ties it to user id.
            -Not sure how I deal with a new registration, maybe add the username to the bridge table
            -Display bridge table on home feed...
