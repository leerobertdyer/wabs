# WriteABadSong
A social Media website based around songwriting that encourages quantity over quality, and promotes collaboration.

Still very much in development ;)


# WORK LOG:
PROGRESS!
-   After weeks, I've finally managed to implement extended dropbox tokens to each new user on registration. 
-   I've started to implement them in my file uploads, but still have some work to do. Namely:
        -When uploading a duplicate song I get an error from my database because it doesn't allow duplicate links. This is a valid error, but I need to handle it more gracefully...
        -I'll need to now use the links from the files to update the song player and feed the home page with a scrollable element.
