# WriteABadSong
A social Media website based around songwriting that encourages quantity over quality, and promotes collaboration.

Still very much in development 

# BUGS:
-   Sort function not working on star click. It reverts to newest, but doesn't change the title of filter...
-   If you register, but decline to authorize dbx, then there is nothing in place to stop you from submitting, it will end up with an error
        to solve it I'll need to implement a redirect to auth when a user without a token tries to submit

# To Do:
-   add a button to collab with each Collab post. 
        -This button will open a unique page where you can:
                -leave notes to each other
                -provide music for the lyricist to check off on
                -provide lyrics for the musician to check off on
                -There will be a finalize button 
                    -once both users click finalize the new song will be posted as a SPECIAL collab bonus pts

-   I need to start implementing a points system, and pages to display the current monthly winner...
-   Badges for collaboraters/monthly winners/most active
-   messaging on posts
-   DM messaging capability
-   notifications via email and/or text
-   noticications number and dropdown by username above login bar
-   link user names to user profiles make profile pages dynamic
-   make delete function actually delete form dbx
-   Do something with load time for new song submission... display a loading wheel at least...
-   follow other users 
-   Win “prizes” or badges each month based on point system 
-   Scoreboard page
-   Add/update bio
